# Reproducible-Science-and-Figures-Assignment

### Aims:

This project addressed the importance of reproducibility in science with a focus on open science and good practices in coding. These practices are carried out in an exemplar data pipeline which investigates the Palmer Penguin dataset.

### Data pipeline:

The data pipeline involves the production of an exploratory figure to generate a biological hypothesis about the penguin data. The hypothesis generated is whether there is a significant difference in culmen length between three penguin species (Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap).

### Key results:

- Significant difference in culmen length bewteen penguins
- Significant difference between Adelie penguins compared with both Chinstrap and Gentoo

### Evaluation:

Coding practices evaluated by a partner and reflection carried out.
